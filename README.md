# Time-Lag-Analysis
Analysis of Gamma-ray and Radio time-series (light curves) of blazars: accreting supermassive black holes with their jets oriented along our line of sight.

Using DCCFs (Discrete Cross Correlation Functions), the code in this repo identifies correlations/anti-correlations, and measure time lags, between these extreme ends of the electromagnetic spectrum.

See [**DCCF_Analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/sam-m-ward/Time-Lag-Analysis/blob/main/DCCF_Analysis.ipynb) for example use case.
