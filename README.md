# Time-Lag-Analysis
Analysis of Gamma-ray and Radio time-series (light curves) of blazars: accreting supermassive black holes with their jets oriented along our line of sight.

Repo used to identify correlations/anti-correlations and measure time lags between time-series data using DCCFs (Discrete Cross Correlation Functions).

See [**DCCF_Analysis.ipynb**](https://github.com/sam-m-ward/Time-Lag-Analysis/blob/main/DCCF_Analysis.ipynb) for example use case.
